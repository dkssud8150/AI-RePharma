Page 2\n\nAuthor ManuscriptIn addition to its thoroughly investigated role in bone formation, the osteoblast master\n                            transcription factor RUNX2 also promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Here we\n                            demonstrate that 17β-estradiol (E2), which is known to attenuate bone turnover in vivo and\n                            RUNX2 activity in vitro, strongly inhibits RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis\n                            in co-cultures. Towards deciphering the underlying mechanism, we induced premature expression\n                            of RUNX2 in primary murine pre-osteoblasts, which resulted in robust differentiation of co-\n                            cultured splenocytes into mature osteoclasts. This was attributable to RUNX2-mediated increase\n                            in RANKL secretion, determined by ELISA, as well as to RUNX2-mediated increase in RANKL\n                            association with the osteoblast membrane, demonstrated using confocal fluorescence microscopy.\n                            The increased association with the osteoblast membrane was recapitulated by transiently\n                            expressed GFP-RANKL. E2 abolished the RUNX2-mediated increase in membrane-associated\n                            RANKL and GFP-RANKL, as well as the concomitant osteoclastogenesis. RUNX2-mediated\nAuthor ManuscriptRANKL cellular redistribution was attributable in part to a decrease in Opg expression, but E2 did\n                            not influence Opg expression either in the presence or absence of RUNX2. Diminution of\n                            RUNX2-mediated osteoclastogenesis by E2 occurred regardless of whether the pre-osteoclasts\n                            were derived from wild type or estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-knockout mice, suggesting that\n                            activated ERα inhibited osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis by acting in osteoblasts, possibly\n                            targeting RUNX2. Furthermore, the selective ER modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen and raloxifene\n                            mimicked E2 in abrogating the stimulatory effect of osteoblastic RUNX2 on osteoclast\n                            differentiation in the co-culture assay. Thus, E2 antagonizes RUNX2-mediated RANKL\n                            trafficking and subsequent osteoclastogenesis. Targeting RUNX2 and/or downstream mechanisms\n                            that regulate RANKL trafficking may lead to the development of improved SERMs and possibly\n                            non-hormonal therapeutic approaches to high turnover bone disease.\n\nAuthor ManuscriptKeywords\n                            Postmenopausal Osteoporosis; TRAP; Protein Trafficking; Secretion\n\n                      1.0 - INTRODUCTION\n                                         Runx2 is as an osteoblast master regulator that is required for bone formation. Initially\n                                         identified based on its interaction with the bone-specific Osteocalcin promoter in vitro [1–\n                                         3], the pivotal role of Runx2 in osteogenesis in vivo was demonstrated by the absence of\n                                         differentiated osteoblasts and failure of skeletal mineralization in Runx2-deficient mice [4,\n                                         5]. Furthermore, inhibition of Runx2 in vitro abrogates expression of osteoblast markers, and\n                                         its forced expression in non-osteoblasts induces bone-like cellular phenotypes [2, 3].\n                                         Contrasting the role of Runx2 as a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation and\nAuthor Manuscript                        embryonic bone development, its function in bone resorption is less appreciated. Over-\n                                         expression of Runx2 in osteoblasts resulted in increased osteoclast differentiation from co-\n                                         cultured pre-osteoclasts in vitro [6–8] and exaggerated bone resorption in vivo [6, 9].\n                                         Conversely, expression of a dominant negative RUNX2 decreased osteoclastogenesis in co-\n                                         culture assays and decreased bone resorption in vivo [7]. Accordingly, osteoclast number\n                                         decreased in mice with either global or osteoblast-specific Runx2 ablation [4, 10]. Thus,\n                                         RUNX2 promotes both osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis.\n\n                                                     Bone.

Among osteoblast-borne signals\n                                         mediating this coupling is the quintessential osteoclastogenic factor RANKL [12–14].\n                                         Although RUNX2 can increase RANKL mRNA levels in smooth muscle cells [15],\n                                         stimulation of osteoclastogenesis by RUNX2 does not appear to involve the regulation of\n                                         Rankl mRNA levels in osteoblasts [8, 16, 17]. Indeed, using primary osteoblast cultures, the\n                                         present work demonstrates that RUNX2 influences RANKL through regulating its\n                                         trafficking to the cell membrane without significantly affecting its mRNA expression.\n\n                                         Postmenopausal osteoporosis inflicts a pathological fracture on two in every five women\n                                         over the age of fifty [18]. It is mostly attributable to reduced stimulation of estrogen receptor\n                                         α (ERα) in osteoblasts and osteoclasts [19]. Accordingly, estrogens and selective estrogen\n                                         receptor modulators (SERMs) constitute therapeutic options for the preservation of bone\nAuthor Manuscript                        mass in postmenopausal women, and some SERMs have beneficial effects on the skeleton\n                                         when used for the management of breast cancer [20]. Based on previous reports on\n                                         inhibition of RUNX2 activity by ERα [21], as well as resistance to ovariectomy-induced\n                                         bone loss in mice expressing of a dominant negative RUNX2 isoform [7], we hypothesized\n                                         that activation of ERα in osteoblasts attenuates RUNX2-driven osteoclastogenic signal(s).\n                                         Indeed, we show that estrogen signaling in osteoblasts abrogates RUNX2-mediated RANKL\n                                         membrane association and differentiation of co-cultured splenocytes into mature osteoclasts.\n\n                      2.0 - MATERIALS AND METHOD\n                      2.1 - Animals\n                                         C57BL/6 JAX® mice from Jackson Laboratory (Sacramento, CA) were used for the\nAuthor Manuscript                        extraction of both osteoblasts and splenocytes without regard to mouse gender.

Because estrogens inhibit RUNX2 activity\n                                        [21], we asked whether they would inhibit osteoclast differentiation driven by expression of\n                                        RUNX2 in co-cultured osteoblasts. First, we transduced Newborn Mouse Calvarial\n                                        Osteoblasts (NeMCO) with lentiviruses encoding doxycycline (dox)-inducible FLAG-\n                                        RUNX2 [24] and treated the so-called NeMCO/Rx2dox cells in isolation with dox and/or\nAuthor Manuscript                       estradiol (E2) for 48 hours. As demonstrated by Western blot analysis, dox induced RUNX2\n                                        expression in day-2 NeMCO/Rx2dox cultures from a hardly detectable level to a level\n                                        several fold higher than that of endogenous RUNX2 on day 6 (Figure 1A). As expected, the\n                                        induction of RUNX2 was accompanied with stimulation of the osteoblast marker genes\n                                        Osteocalcin (Oc; Figure 1C) and Osterix (Osx; Figure 1D). RUNX2-mediated stimulation of\n                                        these target genes was significantly attenuated by E2 (Figure 1C, D), consistent with\n                                        previous reports on inhibition of RUNX2 activity and impediment of osteoblast\n                                        differentiation [21, 29].

Thus, we established a system for conditional,\n                                         robust RUNX2 induction in primary osteoblast cultures, and documented antagonism of\n                                         RUNX2-mediated stimulation of its target genes by E2.\n\n                      3.2 - Estradiol Antagonizes RUNX2-Mediated Osteoblast-Driven Osteoclastogenesis\n                                         Inhibition of bone resorption by E2 in vivo could be mediated in part by antagonism of\n                                         RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis. We addressed this notion using the\n                                         NeMCO/Rx2dox system by asking whether E2 would antagonize dox-driven\n                                         osteoclastogenesis from co-cultured splenocytes. Consistent with previous observations [6,\n                                         7, 9], induction of RUNX2 in the pre-osteoblasts resulted in an increase in the number of\n                                         differentiated osteoclasts, defined as TRAP-positive cells with ≥3 nuclei (Figure 2A).\n                                         Remarkably, the RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis was not observed in\nAuthor Manuscript                        the presence of E2 (Figure 2A–B). Specifically, the number of osteoclasts that differentiated\n                                         from their splenocytic precursors was increased by 2.7-fold in response to dox, and this\n                                         stimulation was completely abolished in the presence of E2 (Figure 2C).\n\n                                         Inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by E2 may involve activation of ERα not only in osteoblasts\n                                         but also in cells of the osteoclast lineage [30]. To test the potential contribution of ERα\n                                         signaling in pre-osteoclasts, we re-examined the effect of E2 on RUNX2-mediated\n                                         osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis in co-cultures of NeMCO/Rx2dox with splenocytes\n                                         isolated from ERα knockout mice [31]. As shown in Figure 2D, treatment of these co-\n                                         cultures with E2 again blocked RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis even\n                                         though ERα was absent in the splenocytes. These results suggest that E2 blocked RUNX2-\n                                         mediated osteoclastogenesis specifically through crosstalk between osteoblastic RUNX2 and\n                                         osteoblastic ERα.\nAuthor Manuscript\n                      3.3 - E2 Counteracts RUNX2-Driven RANKL Membrane Association\n                                         RANKL is a quintessential factor for osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis. However,\n                                         RUNX2 did not stimulate Rankl mRNA or protein levels in our (Figure 3A,C) and other\n                                         osteoblast culture systems [7, 8]. Opg mRNA, encoding the only identified endogenous\n                                         RANKL antagonist, decreased by ~2-fold in response to RUNX2 in both the presence and\n                                         absence of E2. However, unlike in other osteoblastic culture systems [32, 33], E2 did not\n                                         significantly influence Opg expression in NeMCO (Figure 3B). In pursuit of an inclusive\n                                         model that may explain both RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis and its\n                                         antagonism by E2, we considered the role recently ascribed to RUNX2 in protein trafficking\n                                         and secretion [8, 34], and also the evidence that E2 inhibits RANKL presentation on human\n                                         bone marrow stromal cells in vivo [35]. First, we performed ELISA of medium conditioned\nAuthor Manuscript                        by cells treated with dox and/or E2. Although RUNX2 did not significantly affect Rankl\n                                         mRNA or protein expression (Figure 3A, C), the ELISA disclosed a remarkable 8-fold\n                                         increase in RANKL accumulation in medium conditioned by dox-treated as compared to\n                                         control osteoblasts (Figure 3D). We then treated NeMCO/Rx2dox with dox and/or E2 for\n                                         two days and added RAW264.7/NFκB-Luc reporter cells to the culture wells for the last 24\n                                         hours prior to harvest and luciferase assay. Dox-treated NeMCO/Rx2dox over-expressing\n                                         RUNX2 stimulated luciferase activity in the RAW264.7/NFκB-Luc reporter cells to levels\n                                         8-fold greater than control NeMCO cultured without dox (Figure 3E).

Page 7\n\nAuthor Manuscript                        the luciferase results suggest that RUNX2 stimulates RANKL mobilization, contributing to\n                                         the stimulation of osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis (Figure 2). The anti-RUNX2\n                                         effect of E2, however, was only minimal in the ELISA (Figure 3D) and absent in the\n                                         luciferase assay (Figure 3E). Thus, the robust RUNX-mediated osteoblast-driven\n                                         osteoclastogenesis (Figure 2) is attributable to stimulation of RANKL secretion, but neither\n                                         the ELISA nor the RAW 264.7/NFkB-Luc reporter assay provided an explanation for the\n                                         2.6-fold inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by E2 (Figure 2).\n\n                                         It is believed that osteoblast-borne RANKL promotes osteoclastogenesis primarily through\n                                         cell-cell interaction [36]. We therefore employed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy\n                                         to address the possibility that E2 inhibited RUNX2-mediated RANKL association with the\n                                         osteoblast membrane. As shown in Figure 4A, RUNX2 promoted localization of RANKL at\n                                         the cell perimeter, with a 6-fold increase in membrane association in response to dox (Figure\nAuthor Manuscript                        4B). Furthermore, the RUNX2-mediated enrichment of the cell membrane for RANKL was\n                                         diminished by E2 (Figure 4A,B). To confirm that the effects of RUNX2 and E2 on RANKL\n                                         trafficking were post-translational, and not related to mechanisms of alternative RANKL\n                                         transcription or mRNA splicing, we assessed by fluorescence microscopy the effects of\n                                         RUNX2 and E2 on a transiently expressed GFP-RANKL fusion protein. Similar to the\n                                         effects on endogenous RANKL, RUNX2 stimulated GFP-RANKL membrane association by\n                                         4-fold and again this was diminished by E2 (Figure 4C,D). Taken together, our results\n                                         suggest that expression of RUNX2 in osteoblasts promotes osteoclastogenesis by increasing\n                                         membrane association and/or secretion of RANKL, and that E2 antagonizes RUNX2-\n                                         mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis primarily by attenuating the presentation of\n                                         RANKL on the osteoblast membrane.\n\nAuthor Manuscript3.4 - E2 blocks RUNX2-mediated stimulation of Pstpip2\n                                         To identify potential genes that mediate RUNX2-driven RANKL membrane trafficking and\n                                         its antagonism by estrogens, we profiled mRNA expression in NeMCO cultures treated by\n                                         dox (to induce RUNX2) and/or E2. Consistent with previous reports [21, 29], E2 globally\n                                         attenuated the response to RUNX2 (Figure 5, scatter plot). We selected candidate genes that\n                                         could potentially explain the reciprocal effects of RUNX2 and E2 on RANKL trafficking by\n                                         first ranking all genes based on the sum absolute fold-stimulation by dox (RUNX2;\n                                         Supplemental Table 1, column B) and fold-repression by E2 in the presence of dox\n                                         (Supplemental Table 1; column D). We next validated the microarray results by RT-qPCR\n                                         analysis of the five genes with the highest sum absolute response and with at least 1.3-fold\n                                         response to RUNX2 alone (Supplemental Table 1, column F). The RT-qPCR results,\n                                         obtained in an independent experiment (Figure 5) generally recapitulated the microarray\nAuthor Manuscript                        results (Supplemental Table 1). Among the five genes with a >1.2 response to RUNX2 and\n                                         the highest sum absolute response to RUNX2 and E2 was Proline-Serine-Threonine\n                                         Phosphatase Interacting Protein 2 (Pstpip2) (Figure 5), whose DNA sequence is 48%\n                                         identical to Fission Yeast Imp2 and is therefore predicted to play a critical role in membrane\n                                         trafficking [37].\n\n                                                    Bone.

SERMs also have the unique feature of acting in osteoblasts as partial\n                                         ER agonists, accounting for their bone-sparing properties [38]. We therefore set out to test\n                                         the effects of SERMs on RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis. First, we\n                                         confirmed the transcriptional regulatory properties of SERMs in NeMCO and in MCF7\n                                         breast cancer cells. Tam and Ral antagonized E2-mediated stimulation of the classical ER\n                                         target gene TFF1 (pS2) in MCF7 cells without significantly regulating gene expression on\n                                         their own (Figure 6A, B). In contrast, Tam and Ral did not have a lasting anti-estrogenic\n                                         effect on the ERα target gene Fasl in NeMCO cultures (Figure 6D). In fact, they mimicked\nAuthor Manuscript                        E2 in NeMCO (Figure 6C), similar to observations previously made in U2OS-ERα cells\n                                         [39]. Next, to test whether the established bone-sparing properties of SERMs could be\n                                         mediated in part by mimicking E2 in attenuating RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven\n                                         osteoclastogenesis, we treated co-cultures of splenocytes and NeMCO/Rx2dox cells with dox\n                                         and/or SERMs. Similar to E2, both Tam and Ral abolished osteoclast differentiation when\n                                         driven by RUNX2 expression in the co-cultured NeMCO (Figure 6E), and this was not\n                                         associated with alterations to expression of Runx2 itself (Figure 6F). These results suggest\n                                         that the bone sparing properties of SERMs are attributable in part to antagonism of RUNX2-\n                                         mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis.\n\n                      4.0 - DISCUSSION\n                                         It is well established that accelerated bone turnover increases fracture risk, with\nAuthor Manuscript                        postmenopausal osteoporosis serving a prime example. Bone loss that occurs at\n                                         physiological turnover rates is slow and usually transpires without pathological\n                                         consequences because coupling mechanisms secure the replacement of most of the resorbed\n                                         bone with newly deposited material. Adding to classical coupling mechanisms of signaling\n                                         from osteoblasts to osteoclasts and back, the regulation of both osteoblast differentiation and\n                                         osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis by the same transcription factor, RUNX2, likely\n                                         contributes to balanced bone remodeling. Our results suggest that estrogens may regulate\n                                         bone turnover rate by antagonizing RUNX2 in osteoblasts.

We cannot rule out additional RUNX2-driven osteoclastogenic mechanisms such as stimulation of Sema7a and Ltc4s expression [8]. It will also be interesting to investigate whether RUNX2 controls RANKL trafficking in non-osteoblasts, such as breast cancer and vascular smooth muscle cells, in which ectopic expression of these two regulators has been linked to human disease [15, 40, 41].\n\nRUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis may have important implications for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Indeed, E2 diminished the RUNX2-mediated differentiation of co-cultured splenocytes into mature osteoclasts (Figure 2). This anti-osteoclastogenic effect of E2 must now be further investigated, as it may represent a fundamental mechanism underlying the bone-sparing property of estrogens in vivo. In the present study, E2 antagonized RUNX2-mediated membrane association of both endogenous RANKL and transiently expressed GFP-RANKL (Figure 4), but it did not antagonize RUNX2-mediated inhibition of Opg expression (Figure 3B). Thus, whereas RUNX2-mediated RANKL membrane localization and secretion may be mediated by inhibition of Opg expression, other mechanisms remain to be delineated that explain the anti-RUNX2 effect of E2 with respect to RANKL membrane association. That E2 decreased RANKL membrane association (Figure 4) and osteoclastogenesis (Figure 2) without significantly decreasing RANKL measured in conditioned media (Figure 3D) is consistent with the idea that RANKL is most effective in promoting osteoclastogenesis when anchored in the membrane of presenting cells [42]. Indeed, RANKL presentation was greater on the surface of pre-osteoblasts isolated from the bone marrow of hypogonadal postmenopausal women as compared to either age-matched eugonadal pre-menopausal or hormone-repleted postmenopausal controls [35].\n\nThe bone sparing property of E2 in vivo is mediated by activation of ERα in cells of both the osteoblast and the monocyte/osteoclast linages. The former is responsible for protection of cortical bone in females and cortical and trabecular bone in males, whereas the latter is responsible for protection of female trabecular bone [19, 43, 44]. In our in vitro co-culture assay, E2 antagonized RUNX2-mediated osteoblast-driven osteoclastogenesis by activating ERα in osteoblasts, not osteoclasts, because the antagonism was fully recapitulated with ERα-deficient osteoclast precursors (Figure 2C). Given that RUNX2-mediated osteoclastogenesis in vivo primarily occurred at the endosteal aspect of cortical bone [6, 9], the anti-RUNX2 activity of estrogens with respect to regulating RANKL membrane association and osteoclastogenesis is likely most relevant to protection of cortical bone in females and both bone compartments in males.\n\nAlthough RANKL expression has been reported in cells of different stages of the osteoblast lineage, from early bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors to matrix-embedded osteocytes [45–47], it is predominant in stages that precede the onset of DMP-1 expression [48]. Accordingly, early ablation of RANKL in vivo (with Prx1-Cre, Osx1-Cre and Osteocalcin-Cre) completely abrogated osteoclastogenesis, whereas DMP-1-Cre-driven ablation of RANKL from mature osteoblasts and osteocytes [49] resulted in only partial loss of osteoclastogenesis [48].
